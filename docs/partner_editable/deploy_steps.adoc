. Once your account has been created, you can log into the UI. Skip the wizard which prompts addition of your first AWS account; the AWS Control Tower integration will manage this on your behalf.
. Instead of using the wizard in the console, you will be automating the process of adding all current and future AWS Control Tower Accounts to the Trend Micro Cloud One – Workload Security console.

. In the Workload Security console, navigate to Administration > User Management > API Keys and click new. Select a name for the key and Full Access Role. Be sure to save this string as it cannot be retrieved later. This key will be used to authenticate the automation from the AWS Control Tower Master to the console API.
